Sharmer News App:  
A Single Page Application which navigates using React Router, and displays news stories pulled via APIs and renders them as components.  
-Pulls several APIs to display individual news stories which appear as modals and link to full website.  
-Pulls EPL API to display current team standings. Also pulls an API for current NFL game results.  
-Enter local zip code to display current weather conditions on home page.  
  
Ideas:  
-use framer motion for animations  
Make responsive to screen size changes: make nav bar into button, display only 1 story for width, etc.
