Sharmer News App:  
A Single Page Application which navigates using React Router, and displays news stories pulled via APIs and renders them as components  
  
Ideas:  
Find my weather by entering zip code into form  
Click x on a story to eliminate it and pull a different one  
Add additional pages/sub pages  
Can scroll down - but only the display component scrolls, the rest stay anchored  
Fun fact of the day/on this day in history component (with close button option. API only pulls every 24h)  
Better ideas for a useful form?  
Make responsive to screen size changes: make nav bar into button, display only 1 story for width, etc.
